After several wonderful undergraduate years at Leipzig, I felt confident about my Physics skills and decided to apply to one of the best Physics faculties on the planet, and definitely one of the most fairy-tale like cities - Heidelberg. 
I had visited Heidelberg twice as a tourist before and had fallen for the city.

Lets break down how the admission procedure works according to Heidelberg's website. There are two parts of the admission,

1. BSc grades (worth 15 points)

2. Interview (worth 15 points)

The number of seats is for the program **not limited**. In total, if you get $\geq 16$ points, you are admitted to the program. If you have good grades in your BSc, you are already there. 

Now, jumping to the interview. My interview was scheduled to take place on July 21. You know before hand the professors who are going to interview you, I would highly reccomend you google them before the date if you want. Its just human psychology to feel a bit more comfortable talking to someone if you know something about them. 

One of the most common questions I recieve is, "How do I prepare for the interview?". If you are just coming out of your BSc and are applying, you really cannot. The questions asked are from basically a summary from what you learned. If its been a while since you have did physics, then maybe I could give you some pointers, but thats another whole blog.
