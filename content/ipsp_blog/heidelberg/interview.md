## <span style = "color:orange"> Application to Heidelberg </span>

After several wonderful undergraduate years at Leipzig,  I applied to one of the best physics faculties on the planet, and definitely one of the most fairy-tale like cities - Heidelberg. I had visited Heidelberg twice as a tourist before and had fallen for the city.

Lets break down how the admission procedure works according to Heidelberg's website. There are two parts of the admission,

1. BSc grades (worth 15 points) (5th semester grades if your final degree certificate is not available when you are applying)

2. Interview (worth 15 points)

The number of seats is for the program **not limited**. In total, if you get $\geq 16$ points, you are admitted to the program. If you have good grades in your BSc, you are almost there.

Now, jumping to the interview. You know before hand the professors who are going to interview you, I would highly recommend you google them before the date if you want. Its just human nature to feel a bit more comfortable talking to someone if you know something about them.

One of the most common questions I receive is, "How do I prepare for the interview?". The questions asked are from basically a summary from what you learned during your Bachelor's.

## <span style = "color:orange"> Pointers for preparation </span>

1. They would assume that you are well versed in the following undergraduate subjects, 
   - *Classical mechanics (Including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics aka Analytical mechanics)*
   - *Electrodynamics*
   - *Vibrations and Waves*
   - *Special relativity*
   - *Quantum mechanics*
   - *Statistical mechanics*
2. If you know your own gaps and loopholes, you can fill them conceptually by reading the respective chapters from the Feynman's lectures. 
3. There are a series of physics books by *Daniel Fleisch*. Most **results** and *how they are derived* in these books will be "obvious facts" that the professors might expect you to know. They are small booklets summarizing the main results of each of the following subjects.
   - *A student's guide to Maxwell equations (For Electrodynamics)* 
   - *A student's guide to Waves (For Vibrations and Waves)*
   - *A student's guide to Schrodinger equation (For Quantum mechanics)* 
4. For the other subjects, Feynman lectures should be enough as I mentioned. But, there are a few things that Feynman lectures do not cover. Use these for them,
   - *Thermal Physics* by Blundell (Thermodynamics and Statistical mechanics)
   - *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems*  by Marion, Thornton (For Analytical mechanics)
   - *Special relativity and Classical field theory* by Leonard Susskind (First 3 chapters should be good enough for Special relativity)
5. If you have a friend who is very well versed in all these subjects, ask them to test your basic understanding of these subjects (Not someone who is looking to show off their knowledge, but rather someone who is genuinely willing to help -  the first type of person will cause more harm than good)

## <span style = "color:orange"> Interview Questions </span>

The most important advice I can give is that, **keywords** are much powerful than an elaborate explanation during such an interview.

### <span style = "color:#3db18b"> General questions </span>

1. Why are you applying to Heidelberg?
   - There are 8-9 specializations at Heidelberg. Preferably talk about the one you are most interested in. Or if there are a few faculty members that you would specifically like to work with mention them. They just want to see that you have a reason to apply, both of the reasons mentioned above should suffice.
2. What did you do for your BSc Thesis/ Project?
   - This is for people who had a thesis I am presuming during the BSc. The task here would be to summarize what you did as quickly as possible.

### <span style = "color:#3db18b"> Physics questions </span>

(Answer them as concisely as possible using the keywords, Ill put the keywords in italics) - I am trying to recall exactly what I answered, I am going to write the answers **exactly** as I answered them. 

1. ***How would you solve quantum mechanical Hydrogen atom?***
   
   - Take the *3D Schrodinger equation*, use *separation of variables* and then you will get a *radial* and an *angular* equation.

2. ***What would be the next step?***
   
   - For the radial equation we make a typical *ansatz* and for the *radial* equation we have the spherical harmonics as the solution.
     (Yeah, I literally just said that we make a typical ansatz. If they had asked me what it exactly is, I would have said it. I think answering quickly and pointing them in the right direction is better than taking a lot of time for a perfect answer. As I said, keywords can do magic).

3. ***What are the boundary conditions?***
   
   - For the radial equation, the *wavefunction should go to zero* at the center. This ensures that it doesn't *blow up* for $r\to 0$. Also , it *should go to zero* at $r\to \infty $ , because, for anything else, it physically doesn't make sense. (Just like a for a finite charge, it makes sense for electric field to be $r\to\infty\implies\vec{E}=0$. If this is not the case, then a finite charge will affect particles on the other end of the universe).

4. ***For such a system, why are the angular momentum quantities discrete?***
   
   - It is due to the* symmetry*. We have the *angles identified* as $\theta\in[0,\pi)$ and $\phi\in[0,2\pi]$. This will give rise to the boundary conditions giving us discretized values for the angular momentum numbers for $l,m$.

5. ***How are the $l$ discretized?***
   
   - Me : Umm, $l(l\pm1)$
     Interviewer : Seems like you don't care about $\hbar$? (The question was asked with a cheerful tone)
     Me : Eh, its 1. (Cheeky smile audible in my voice)
     Interviewer : Haha, I guessed so. Good, lets move on to a different topic.

6. How would you define temperature for any system?
   
   - Me : Uh, any system?   Interviewer : Yeah, that is one of the physical quantities that can always be defined for literally any system.
     Me : (Sudden response while being worried) "Maxwell Boltzmann distribution" ?! (At the same time, the interviewer was hinting by saying think "mean energy")
     Interviewer : Super.

7. How would you define temperature in general?
   
   1. Its the vibrational energy of the molecules or the particles.

And, that was it. I asked them how long does it take for the results to be out? They told me that it would be a couple of days.

### Other questions I collected off from the internet and from collegues.
