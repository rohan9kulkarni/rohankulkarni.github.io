* " * " before the question means "Looks much harder than reality"
* " ! " before the question means "Does involve very tedious computations"
* What is the difference between priority I and II?
  * **Priority I** : You should definitely be able to solve the problem from start to end without any help. The concepts and the techniques used to solve are equally equal important.
  * **Priority II** : The problems can involve some tedious integrals. In principle, the exam should not have ridiculously long algebra or integration. The concepts around these questions can give you a lot of insights.

**IMPORTANT:** ***The mock exam / sheet 12 are priority level I questions in an exam format. They were given out so that one could test themselves. I hope it goes without saying that these problems are at least as important as Priority I questions, or even more important.***

* Being a physics exam, you won't have purely mathematical problems, but you definitely will need results from many of the mathematical exams straight away. Basically, you should know what is the divergence theorem, stokes theorem, etc and how to take line/surface/volume integrals (at least for good symmetric surfaces)

| **Mathematical concepts needed from these problems** |
| :--------------------------------------------------: |
|               (0.2) : Vector Calculus                |
|        (0.3) : Coordinate systems & Jacobians        |
|                (0.4) : Line integrals                |
|          (1.1) : Gauss / Divergence theorem          |
|                (2.1) : Stokes theorem                |

### What about the questions I did not list?

* Most of the unlisted problems were purely mathematical problems like 

  * (5.3) Green's function of Laplace operator
  * (6.3) Orthogonal basis functions 
  * etc

  As I mentioned already, being an electrodynamics exam, it would be weird if there was a big chunk of a purely mathematical problem without any electrodynamics associated to it. Nevertheless, you can definitely expect small conceptual problems from these.

* What about the non-mathematical problems like

  * (3.2) Electrostatic potential and field of a thin rod
  * (7.2) Gauss law for a point charge
  * etc

  Well, as mentioned once before in the blog, exam is an affair of 3 hours. These problems contain very long and tedious computations. The concepts around these problems are definitely important - but, these concepts are already covered in one of the Priority I/II level questions.

***NOTE : This does not mean that these unmarked questions are not important for physics. For example, both (5.3) and (6.3) are extremely crucial to various places in physics. You cannot have Feynman diagrams without Green's functions in Modern QFT. You cannot have general solutions to even the most basic quantum mechanical problems without orthogonal basis functions***
