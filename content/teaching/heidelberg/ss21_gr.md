## <span style="color:orange"> **Organizational details** </span>

- M.Sc. Physics core course worth 8 ECTS
- https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~amendola/gr-ss2021.html - Course homepage on Prof. Amendola's personal website
- Assignment details :
  - Need 50% correct on them in order to be eligible for the exam in July
  - Can hand them in groups of two (Highly recommended)

## <span style="color:orange"> **Literature** </span>

#### <span style="color:salmon"> Personal recommendations </span>

- <span style = "color:mediumaquamarine"> **_Lecture notes on GR_ - David Tong**  </span>
  - Like all of his notes, you can never go wrong. You can find them [here](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/gr.html)
- <span style = "color:mediumaquamarine">***General relativity : An introduction for physicists*** - **Hobson**. </span>
  - Classic text. Uses modern notations and language. Exactly the right amount of treatment of differential geometry needed. Very lucid and smooth explanations of concepts. Does a complete treatment of SR before jumping into GR (Which is really important)
- <span style = "color:mediumaquamarine">***Relativity, Gravitation and Cosmology*** -  **Lambourne**  </span>
  - Easiest GR text I've come across till date. Good as a first introduction, but in no way complete enough for a proper MS level course.

#### <span style="color:salmon"> Recommendation according to Prof. Amendola's notes </span>

- <span style = "color:mediumaquamarine">  **_A first course in General relativity_ - Bernard Schutz**  </span>
  - A very standard text for a first course in GR. Looking to Prof. Amendola's notes, I am going to assume this to be the main reference book for his lectures.
- <span style = "color:mediumaquamarine">  **_Lecture notes on GR_ - Sean Carroll**  </span> : https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9712019.pdf
  - Another common text. It is undoubtedly an excellent book - a lot of diagrams and explanations.  Although, I do remember getting lost in the first three chapters while not realizing the bigger picture. Try to avoid that mistake and would be an amazing read.
