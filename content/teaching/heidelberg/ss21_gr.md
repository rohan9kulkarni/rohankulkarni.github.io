## <span style="color:orange"> **Organizational details** </span>

- M.Sc. core course worth 8 ECTS
- https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~amendola/gr-ss2021.html - Course homepage on Prof. Amendola's personal website
- More details on % of homework needed for exam entrance,  etc will be added as I receive more information from the Obertutor

## <span style="color:orange"> **Literature** </span>

#### <span style="color:#3db18b"> Personal recommendations </span>
- <span style = "color:#158FBF"> ***Lecture notes on GR by David Tong*** </span>
  - Like all of his notes, you can never go wrong. I have some parts of most of the lecture notes he has and they are an absolute gem. 
- <span style = "color:#158FBF">***General relativity : An introduction for physicists*** - Hobson. </span>
  - Classic text. Uses modern notations and language. Exactly the right amount of treatment of differential geometry needed. Very lucid and smooth explanations ofconcepts. Does a complete treatment of SR before jumping into GR (Which is really important)
- <span style = "color:#158FBF">***Relativity, Gravitation and Cosmology*** - Lambourne. </span>
  - Easiest GR text I've come across till date. Good as a first introduction, but in no way complete enough for a proper MS level course.

#### <span style="color:#3db18b"> Recommendation according to Prof. Amendola's notes </span>

Analytical mechanics - Nolting

Introduction to Electrodynamics - David Griffiths
