Currently, I am a Masters student at the University of Heidelberg doing advanced courses in Quantum field theories and Cosmology. I graduated with a BSc in Physics from the University of Leipzig. During my undergraduate years, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for 3 years for various subjects in Theoretical Physics, Mathematics, and Experimental Physics. My final bachelor’s thesis had the topic “Black holes, Singularity theorems and the Global Structure of Spacetime”.

The main purpose of this website apart from "who I am and what I have done", is outreach. The past 5 years of my life have been revolving around one thing - _Theoretical Physics_. While on this amazing journey, there were many such instances where I felt "if only someone had told me that, I would have saved hours of work" or "that one statement made me understand xyz". I want to pass on the wisdom and tools I gained on this journey to my colleagues and anyone trying to decipher the breathtaking world of physics. I plan to continuosly keep updating the "notes" and "literature" tabs, one page at a time. Also, thinking of starting a regular blog about things like, my learning techniques, note taking algorithms, etc.

I hope whoever found this website gains something useful from it. If not, you just got aquainted with another friendly face :)
