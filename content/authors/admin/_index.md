Currently, I am a Masters student at the University of Heidelberg. I have been recently accepted as a Graduate Research Trainee at McGill University and will be working on my MSc Thesis with Prof. Katelin Schutz. The project that I am very much looking forward to and will be working on for a year will be based on topics in *Axion dark matter*.

 I finished my Masters coursework in Heidelberg on the following subjects:
- **Core**
  - Quantum Field Theory I  (8 ECTS)
  - Cosmology (8 ECTS)
  - General Relativity (8 ECTS - Transfer from Leipzig)
- **Specialization courses**
  - Advanced Quantum Field Theory (8 ECTS)
  - Standard Model of Particle Physics (8 ECTS - Level II course in Particle Physics comprising of 50% Experimental and 50% Theoretical content)
  - Relativistic quantum mechanics (6 ECTS)
- **Seminars and Block courses**
  - Dark matter theory (6 ECTS - Compulsory Masters seminar)
  - Black holes in Physics and Astrophysics (2 ECTS - Block course)

I graduated with a BSc in Physics from the University of Leipzig. During my undergraduate years, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for 3 years for various subjects in Theoretical Physics, Mathematics, and Experimental Physics totalling over 300 hours of undergraduate level classroom teaching. My final bachelorâ€™s thesis had the topic *Black holes, Singularity theorems and the Global Structure of Spacetime*.

The main purpose of this website apart from *who I am and what I have done*, is outreach. The past 5 years of my life have been revolving around one thing - _Theoretical Physics_. While on this amazing journey, there were many such instances where I felt "*if only someone had told me that, I would have saved hours of work*" or "that one statement made me understand xyz". I want to pass on the wisdom and tools I gained on this journey to my colleagues and anyone trying to decipher the breathtaking world of physics. I plan to continuously keep updating the "notes" and "literature" tabs, one page at a time. Also, I am thinking of starting a regular blog about things like, my learning techniques, note taking algorithms, etc.

I hope whoever found this website gains something useful from it. If not, you just got acquainted with another friendly face :)
