Hi there!  I am studying M.Sc. Physics at the *Heidelberg University* in Germany and a *graduate reseach trainee* McGill University in Canada. I am working on my MSc Thesis with Prof. Katelin Schutz. I am working on projects based on Solar axions (Astroparticle theory).

 I finished my M.Sc coursework in Heidelberg on the following subjects:

- **Core** : *Quantum Field Theory I, Cosmology, General Relativity*
- **Specialization courses** : *Advanced Quantum Field Theory, Standard Model of Particle Physics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics*
- **Seminars and Block courses** : *Dark matter theory, Black holes in Physics and Astrophysics*

I graduated with a B.Sc in Physics from Leipzig University in Germany. During my undergraduate years, I worked several years as a Teaching Assistant in Theoretical Physics, Mathematics, and Experimental Physics; totalling over 250 hours of undergraduate level classroom teaching. My final bachelorâ€™s thesis had the topic *Black holes, Singularity theorems and the Global Structure of Spacetime*.

The primary purpose of this website, apart from *who I am and what I have done*, is outreach. These past five years of my life revolve around one thing - _Theoretical Physics_. While on this incredible journey, there were numerous instances where I had the thought, "*if only someone had told me that, I would have saved hours of work*" or "*that one statement made me understand XYZ*". I want to pass on the wisdom and tools I gained on this journey to my colleagues and anyone trying to decipher the breathtaking world of physics. I plan to keep updating the "notes" and "literature" tabs, one page at a time. Also, I am thinking of starting a regular blog about things like my learning techniques, note-taking algorithms, etc.

I hope whoever found this website gains something useful from it. If not, you just got acquainted with another friendly face :)
