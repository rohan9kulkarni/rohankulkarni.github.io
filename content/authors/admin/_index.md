I will be starting my M.Sc. Physics program at Heidelberg from November 2020. During my undergraduate years, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for 3 years for various subjects in Theoretical Physics, Mathematics, and even Experimental Physics.
My final bachelor’s thesis had the topic “Black holes, Singularity theorems and the Global Structure of Spacetime”.
