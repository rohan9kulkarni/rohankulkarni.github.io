## Abstract
A recent study has found that massive particles like axions emitted from stars
can enter gravitationally bound orbits around them. These particles then accu-
mulate over the large astronomical lifetime of the star, forming a density profile
around them called stellar basins. This density profile is known as the solar
axion basin. In another study, it has been established that an electromagnetic
signal with a wavelength corresponding to half of the axion mass produces a
stimulated decay of axions into photons, which we call an echo. The geometry
of this echo is such that the axion decays into two back-to-back facing photons.
This master’s thesis combines these ideas to predict echo signals from axion stel-
lar basins of various stellar objects, which we call basinschein. First, we predict
the echo of keV axions from the basin of our sun, a white dwarf, and a neutron
star. Secondly, consider the axion basin of our sun for various axion masses and
predict their echo signals. Then, we estimate an echo signal from Milky Way’s
dark matter halo. The echo signal from all these scenarios is too weak to be
detected by past and present instruments; hence, it is improbable that we find a
signature of such a phenomenon in current and archived data.
