I was the TA for this course in 2018, when Dr. Kreisel took this course for the first time in Leipzig. Along with giving a seminar and a tutorial for the course, I also assisted him with _formulating the assignments, giving suggestions on literature and last but not the least, also formulating the exams._

**Preparation for any exam generally has 4 parts according to me :**

1. Understand the assignments and the mock exam. (In the subsequent parts, I will mark the problems according to priorities)
2. Understand the content in the lectures relevant to assignments and mock exam
3. Combine these two points to predict what kind of computations/concepts are more likely to be asked. Find and solve more problems from the literature, etc
4. (If time prevails) Go over content that you feel might be important

Now, I will dissect these parts below!

**Tip 1:** **_Getting a good grade in the exam and understanding 100% of the lectures are not the same thing._**

<hr>

### <span style = "color:#3db19b"  >1. Assignments and mock exam  </span>

**The goal of the assignments were as follows :**

1. To complement the lectures
2. To show you what kind of computations are typically expected by a person who claims to understand "Electrodynamics"
3. Approximately one question on each of the problem sheet addressed a more mathematical question (The goal of these questions is to update your mathematical toolkit)

**The goal of the mock exam:**

* To show you what one must expect from an exam (The outline and the content)

**HINT 1 :** **_In a fair exam, most of the major questions should be similar to something you have done in your assignemnts/mock. If there is a question that does is coming straight from the lecture notes/literature, most likely it will be very easy. So, if you are someone who focused a lot on the homeworks/mock and not a lot on the lectures, don't get startled, read the question and tackle it one step at a time._**

Assignments are expected to be done over a week, whereas an exam is a short affair of 180 minutes. It is quite obvious that everything cannot be tested in your exams. So, from my perspective, I am going to list the priorities of the questions that _I would have foused on, If I were giving TP2 exam_ .

### <span style = "color:#3db19b"  > 2. Understanding the (relevant) content of the lectures </span>

Firstly, If you think carefully, the lectures are divided into 4 sections (I will expand the electrostatics section for you)

1. Mathematical background
2. Electrostatics
   - Coulomb's law and Gauss law
   - Potential and Condutors
   - Laplace equation and special techniques to solve it
     - Image charges
       - Line symmetry
       - Spherical symmetry
     - Separation of variables
       - In cartesian coordinates for rectangular symmetry
       - In spherical coordinates for spherical symmetry
         - Azimuthal symmetry
3. Magnetostatics
4. Maxwell's equations, their properties and wave equation

In such a manner, expand the other sections and look at the prioritized homework problems.

Take the relevant sections from one problem at a time and try to follow them from the lecture notes. **Make a small summary**. If you still don't get it, then pick up one of the recommended literature books like Griffiths or Nolting or use the internet (always use the internet on the side). If you still don't get it, ask your friends to help you, sometime a few words from someone who understands it could be worth a book. If still you don't get it, you could try asking on a forum? Stackexchange maybe? Or ask the lecturer for his office hours?

### <span style = "color:#3db19b"  > 3. Combine point 1 and 2 </span>

Once you are through with point 1 and 2 thoroughly, you should already be well prepared. But, if you want to be absolutely thorough in your preparation, then list problems from Griffiths and Nolting that are similar to 

* Mock exam questions
* Priority I questions

and solve them. (First make a list before starting to solve them)

If you feel you want to cover more problems and solving each and everyone will take a lot of time, 

* Cut down your list to lesser problems
  * Go over the problem and if you feel confident in that particular problem, just have an outline of the solution in your head and look up the solution. If you were right, cross it off right away.

<hr>

### <span style = "color:#3db19b"  > 4. Summarize the content from the lectures that you did not encounter in point 3 </span>

I think this is quite self-explanatory. There will be things covered in the lectures that were not encountered by you in the assignments or anywhere, go over them and summarize them. 

This point is for people who want to be absolutely thorough. Doing point 1+2 should be enough for a decent grade or even an excellent grade (depends on exam to exam). 

<hr>

All the best preparing for the exam. Electrodynamics is one of the most challenging subjects when you attempt it for the first time. But at the same time, the mathematical structure is just something so precise and beautiful.
