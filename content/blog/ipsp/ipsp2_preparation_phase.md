If you have read the part 1 of this blog, you know that everyone who meets the HEQ criteria in the eyes of Uni-assist, gets accepted. **Contrary to most good physics programs over the world, the hard part is not getting accepted to IPSP - it's survival**.  According to me, this mainly is due to three reasons (two of them connected) :

1. People from highly different levels of educational background come together. The difference in knowledge base between the person with the most and the slightest knowledge is tremendous. (I am comparing something very quantitative, i.e. the foundation/basics of a person in physics/math, not something super subjective like " How smart is a person "). Depending on which side of the spectrum you belong to (lots of foundations vs shallow foundations - If you are coming straight out of high school, this will mostly be set in stone by your high school curriculum), you will have different consequences. In both cases, you can end up doing excellent or bad. 
2. (Connected to 1) The program is highly accelerated in terms of the syllabus. You learn and apply concepts in your semester I/II generally taught in top graduate level schools in USA/Canada (Even MIT). These same concepts are usually taught in semester III/IV if you were in a typical B.Sc. Physics in Germany (Non-IPSP) making B.Sc. Physics is already quite accelerated here.

3. The primary job of professors is to conduct research (This is nearly true in all of academia). The difference compared to say North American schools is that, the professors have really none to very little incentive to do their job by going over and beyond. This can pose issues - from slight to a lot. Do not come assuming that, "I am at Leipzig. One of the finest institutions in Germany. I'll pay attention in class and everything will be alright". This might be true at times, but in no way it is true always.

Wrapping all of this together, if you think, "I got in the program, things should be alright", in most of the cases, you couldn't be more wrong!
One has to understand how the idea of University differs in Germany compared to many other countries.
- Other countries : The university is significantly responsible to try the best to make you graduate.
- Germany : The University does want to benefit you, this is true undoubtedly but, You are equally or even more responsible

The answer in itself is actually not that hard. You need to come prepared. Definitely easier said than done, am I right? That is the exact reason for this post. I want to try to guide you in the most simplest way to be able to prepare well for a smooth start in IPSP.
