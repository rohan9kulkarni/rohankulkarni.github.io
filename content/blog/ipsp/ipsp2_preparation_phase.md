If you have read the part 1 of this blog, you know that everyone who meets the HEQ criteria in the eyes of Uni-assist, gets accepted. **Contrary to most good physics programs over the world, getting accepted to IPSP is not the hard part, surviving it is**.  According to me, This mainly is due to three reasons (two of them connected) :

1. People from extremely different levels of educational background come together
2. (Connected to 1) The program is highly accelerated. You really learn and apply concepts in your semester I/II that are generally taught in top graduate level schools in USA/Canada (Even MIT). These same concepts are generally taught in semester III/IV if you were in a typical B.Sc. Physics in Germany (Non-IPSP) making B.Sc. Physics already quite accelerated here.
3. 

If you think, "I got in the program, things should be alright "
