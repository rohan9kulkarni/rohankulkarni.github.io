If you have read the part 1 of this blog, you know that everyone who meets the HEQ criteria in the eyes of Uni-assist, gets accepted. **Contrary to most good physics programs over the world, the hard part is not getting accepted to IPSP, its survival**.  According to me, this mainly is due to three reasons (two of them connected) :

1. People from extremely different levels of educational background come together. The difference of knowledge base between the person with the most knowledge and least knowledge is tremendous at times. (I am comparing something very quantitative i.e. the foundation/basics of a person in physics/math, not something super subjective like " How smart is a person "). Depending on which side of the spectrum you belong (lots of foundations vs very low foundation - If you are coming straight out of high school, this will mostly be set in stone by your high school curriculum) you will have different consequences. In both cases, you can end up doing amazing or bad. 
    1. Someone with a lot of background - You will most like
2. (Connected to 1) The program is highly accelerated in terms of syllabus. You learn and apply concepts in your semester I/II that are generally taught in top graduate level schools in USA/Canada (Even MIT). These same concepts are generally taught in semester III/IV if you were in a typical B.Sc. Physics in Germany (Non-IPSP) making B.Sc. Physics already quite accelerated here.
3. Profs.

If you think, "I got in the program, things should be alright", in most of the cases, you couldn't be wrong!
One has to understand how the idea of University differs in Germany compared to many other countries.
- Other countries : The university is significantly responsible to try the best to make you graduate.
- Germany : The University does want to benefit you, this is true undoubtedly but, You are equally or even more responsible
