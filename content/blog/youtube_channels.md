### <span style = "color:orange"> Highly highly underrated </span>
- [Physics - Mr. P Solver](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKaYxkHrmsQePZFpzF9b7sQ) : Computational techniques are becoming more and more important in all areas of physics. He does an excellent job covering various domains in that area. The channel has nearly everything you would need to know about using python as a physicist. He worked at CERN as a graduate researcher and now is working with imaging techniques for his PhD, legit credentials and A+ content.
- [Physics - Eigenchris](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN8wTUlSAroLslWyf87E2pw) : Just brilliant. Simple conceptual explanations, it is clear that a phenomenal amount of research goes into each of his series. He does an excellent job breaking down the complex of the most complex objects. As I am updating this description, his series on spinors is out which I am currently following. Its nothing less than a masterpiece enabling you to visualize so commonly used concepts in physics at an excellent level.
- [Physics - Pretty Much Physics](https://www.youtube.com/c/prettymuchphysics) : Easily my goto channel if I need a 5-10 min video explaining me something (that I already know or don't). As an example, I recently took a Graduate Quantum Theory course where I honestly saw the Wigner-Ekhart theorem for the first time. I was honestly a bit confused about it and its working. The channel had 2-3 videos covering it, and it did a phenomenal job disscting the theorem with examples in a separate video.
