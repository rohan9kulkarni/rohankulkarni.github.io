## Books

- [Modern Cosmology - S. Dodelson](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Cosmology-Scott-Dodelson/dp/0128159480/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=dodelson&qid=1613777478&sr=8-1) (Reference book, Linear read : Yes & No) <br>
  Expert in the field. His comments, even the smallest ones are precious. Any topic you don't understand you can come to this book.  
  - The sections on Boltzmann equations (3 and 4) and Inflation (chapter 6) are worth a read.

## Lecture notes - Generally complement well in parallel to a formal course

- [David tong's lecture notes ](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/cosmo.html) (Linear reading recommended : Yes & No, depending on your background)
  Probably the best lecture notes available in terms of doing everything from scratch. Like all his other notes, these are a masterpiece.
  -  (Pro/Con) No General relativity required (He does everything Newtonian). 
  -  (Pro) Provides flawless intuition on the subject. Excellent when used as reference notes with respect to a formal course.
  - (Con) It can be hard to follow if you have not been exposed to the subject. Being lecture notes, they do not have inline exercises. Emphasizing the important results gets hard.
- [Daniel Baumann's lecture notes](http://cosmology.amsterdam/education/cosmology/) (Linear reading recommended : Yes)
  No matter what Cosmology course you are doing, these will be there for you. 
  - (Pro) Appendix for General relativity provided, targeted towards the most important results that would be needed for cosmology
  - (Pro) Step-by-step computation of results, lot of diagrams, boxed results could be just taken granted for the first read
  - (Pro) Has lecture "scripts", which are basically extensive summaries of each lecture. Very useful for being able to summarize what you just learned.
