- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> Modern Cosmology - S. Dodelson <br> </span>
  Expert in the field. His comments, even the smallest ones are precious. Any topic you don't understand you can come to this book. The sections on Boltzmann equations (3 and 4) and Inflation (chapter 6) are worth a read.

### <span style="color:orange"> Lecture notes - Generally complement well in parallel to a formal course </span>

- [David tong's lecture notes ](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/cosmo.html) (Linear read? Yes) <br>Probably the best lecture notes available in terms of doing everything from scratch. Like all his other notes, these are a masterpiece. No General relativity required (He does everything Newtonian).  Provides flawless intuition on the subject. Excellent when used as reference notes with respect to a formal course. Being lecture notes, they do not have inline exercises. Emphasizing what are important results and what is a buildup can get hard at times if one does not have previous exposure to the subject. 
- [Daniel Baumann's lecture notes](http://cosmology.amsterdam/education/cosmology/) (Linear read? Yes) <br>No matter what Cosmology course you are doing, these will be there for you. Appendix for General relativity provided, targeted towards the most important results that would be needed for cosmology. Step-by-step computation of results, lot of diagrams, boxed paragraphs could be just taken granted/skipped for the first read. Has lecture "scripts", which are basically extensive summaries of each lecture. Very useful for being able to summarize what you just learned.
