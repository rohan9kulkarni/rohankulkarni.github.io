Disclaimer :  Compared to other subjects, the number of good introductory textbooks in QFT are exponentially more. Everybody has a preference. Being a fairly advanced subject, different people from different backgrounds will have a unique taste when it comes to learn this beautiful subject. Firstly, Ill write down the **introductory** textbooks with which you just cannot go wrong.

- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> Quantum field theory and the Standard model - Matthew Schwartz <br> </span>
	Probably the best "Physics" book I have read. I cannot emphasize how good the book is at everything. Doing it for a self-study might be hard. But, it complements literally ANY QFT course.
