Dark Matter (DM) is like the elusive character in the cosmic dramaâ€”we're pretty sure it exists, know roughly where it hangs out, and have a good idea of how much is out there. Then what's the problem? We're scratching our heads about what it actually is. Most scientists bet on DM being made up of particles, and for a couple of decades, the popular kid on the block was the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). It was a hopeful lead, or some would say, a bit of a bias. 

Dark matter research is one of the hottest fields out there, on all fronts, theoretical, experimental and computational side. What makes it even more attractive is the super interdisciplinary nature of this research. As a theorist you will be dabbling into core QFT, particle physics, cosmology, astrophysics, plasma physics - you name it. As an experimentalist, you might be working with telescopes, colliders, solid state detectors or even tabletop laser setups. Dark matter research doesn't just make you a specialist; it turns you into a well-seasoned, all-around physicist. It's the kind of field that keeps you on your toes and immersed in the thrilling diversity of physics.

I'll be honest, there aren't as many books on DM physics as I would like to be out there. I will put a few references down there, but the primary resources I would reccommend for a newcomer to the dark side are mostly lecture notes. 

The prereqisites in order to understand every single thing that is happening in these lecture notes might be a bit overwhelming due to what has been said in the pink box above.  I'll list down my references with my order of preference and label each of them with $\text{Prerequisite}\in \{\text{Minimal, Moderate, Maximal }\}$ . The bare minimum prerequisites would be one course in QFT/Particle physics and one course in Cosmology. The maximal would correspond to two full courses in QFT, a course in standard model physics and two full courses in cosmology.

Prerequisite : Moderate

These lecture notes are from 2013 which does reflect the a bit of WIMP bias at times (not necessarily due to the author, from what I hear, most of the people working in the field had it.). Anywho, don't let that comment take you away from how fantastic these lecture notes are (so are his video lectures given at the Perimeter Institute). He really takes his time to make you understand the crucial ideas behind dark matter freeze out, variety of dark matter models, non-thermal dark matter production, direct and indirect dark matter detection. These are tools that you will encounter basically any dark matter project. More interesting topics like Dark Matter capture in Stars (one of my areas of reasearch), Axions (my Master's thesis was on attempting to constrain axions further), Collider searches is also covered. He does also have some really nice set of assignments that you could attempt to concretize your understanding.

*Comment :  Some of the videos on PIRSA are not playing due to various errors, try using some plugin that grabs the video and downloads it. The lectures are in 480p or 720p at max, so the quality isn't the best but definitely watchable.*

## :star: Lecture notes on DM physics by Mariangela Lisanti
Prerequisites : Minimal

These fourty page lecture notes might be the exact gataway you need to enter the chaotic yet breathtaking world of DM. All the main topics covered in Morrissey's notes are covered here too. The topics are introduced and explained in an extremely lucid way. The small in-text exercises are rewarding. These fourty pages are pretty much lay the foundationas of DM physics today.
