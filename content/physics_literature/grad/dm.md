Dark Matter (DM) is like the elusive character in the cosmic drama‚Äîwe're pretty sure it exists, know roughly where it hangs out, and have a good idea of how much is out there. Then what's the problem? We're scratching our heads about what it actually is. Most scientists bet on DM being made up of particles, and for a couple of decades, the popular kid on the block was the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). It was a hopeful lead, or some would say, a bit of a bias. 

Dark matter research is one of the hottest fields out there, on all fronts, theoretical, experimental and computational side. What makes it even more attractive is the super interdisciplinary nature of this research. As a theorist you will be dabbling into core QFT, particle physics, cosmology, astrophysics, plasma physics - you name it. As an experimentalist, you might be working with telescopes, colliders, solid state detectors or even tabletop laser setups. Dark matter research doesn't just make you a specialist; it turns you into a well-seasoned, all-around physicist. It's the kind of field that keeps you on your toes and immersed in the thrilling diversity of physics.

I'll be honest, there aren't as many books on DM physics as I would like to be out there. I will put a few references down there, but the primary resources I would reccommend for a newcomer to the dark side are mostly lecture notes. 

The prereqisites in order to understand every single thing that is happening in these lecture notes might be a bit overwhelming due to what has been said in the pink box above.

These lectures are notable for their exceptional clarity and are more recent compared to the alternatives mentioned below. They comprehensively cover all the requisite tools for engaging in the field. An added advantage is the availability of accompanying video lectures, providing an immersive learning experience.


### :star2: PSI Dark Matter by David Morrissey 

<span style="background-color: #7FFF7F; color: #004400; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 50px; display: inline-block; font-size: 10px; margin: 2px;"> Introductory  </span> <span style="background: linear-gradient(45deg, #00CED1, #9370DB); color: #FFFFFF; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 50px; display: inline-block; font-size: 10px; margin: 2px;"> Ideal for Beginners </span>

These lecture notes trace back to 2013, carrying a subtle WIMP bias (more of a field-wide trend at the time than the author's individual stance). But fear not, this bias doesn't overshadow the brilliance of these notes (bonus: the author's video lectures at the Perimeter Institute are top-notch). The author takes a scenic route to ensure you grasp the crucial concepts behind dark matter freeze-out, various models, non-thermal production, and the intricacies of direct and indirect detection ‚Äì essential tools for any dark matter project.

But wait, there's more! Dive into captivating topics like Dark Matter capture in Stars (a personal research area of mine ‚Äì cheers!), Axions (my Master's thesis was all about wrangling in axions a bit more), and Collider searches. The author even spices things up with some cool assignments to solidify your understanding. So, don't hesitate, dive in, and let these notes be your guide to unraveling the mysteries of the dark side! üååüìù 

> Comment :  Some of the videos on PIRSA are not playing due to various errors, try using some plugin that grabs the video and downloads it. The lectures are in 480p or 720p at max, so the quality isn't the best but definitely watchable.
