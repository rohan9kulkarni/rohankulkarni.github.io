### <span style="color:orange"> General advice </span>

Classical mechanics is a field that every person in STEM has studied about to a certain degree in their career. The reason - If you really think about it, it really is the point in time where philosophical arguments started to be converted into concrete physical laws; that could be expressed in the language of Math. The idea of "proof of concept" was set in stone during this period. It was the start of a completely new era for humans as a race.  

Any course that you will ever take as a physicist, will assume this to be a prerequisite. This is the reason why you always see physics coursework starting with this topic. There is no argument to escape it if you want to be a physicist. 

### <span style="color:orange">Best Reference Books </span>

- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Introduction to Classical Mechanics: With Problems and Solutions - David Morin** </span> <br>As the title suggests, Its an introductory book with problems and *solutions*.  As a first course and introductory read, I would suggest the following Chapters : 1 to 5 , 7 to 9. There are TONS and TONS of good problems in this book, along with the solutions. My strategy to attack such a book is, 
  
  - Read a section/chapter (Depending on how big it is respectively)
  - Reread the examples till the point you are sure that you can solve it yourself
    - If you are unable to understand some step, *most likely* you didn't understand a particular concept enough. Reread the respective paragraphs or sections corresponding to that issue
  - Solve 3-5 problems of various difficulties without looking even a single step from the solutions
  - Look at another 2-3 problems of medium-high difficulty, create a solution plan in your head and check if it matches with the steps of the solution
  
  In my eyes, Morin's book is **complete** when it comes to an introductory course in CM. It covers everything from the *basics of free-body-diagrams & circular motion*, *solutions of damped and driven oscillations*, *tons of problems based on conservation laws* to *everything about angular momentum*. It is a self-sufficient book. The only other lecture notes that I would recommend one to follow in parallel would be David Tong's notes (like always), which I have linked below.
  
- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems - Marion, Thornton** </span> <br>
This book is an absolute gem. Unfortunately I didn't hear about it till a year or two in my Bachelors'. Eventually, I used it as a reference occasionally when I have to brush up some of my topics. It's till date my "go to" book whenever I need a recall of some concepts. I personally find the mathematical rigor more sophisticated than Morin's book. This can be extremely beneficial if you need to skim over some topics that you already know about, but might have forgotten minute details; as a quick look into a mathematically precise form of an equation/law can be more powerful than a complete paragraph explaining it (This is if and only if you have studied the topic in detail before).
  
  If you are doing your "Theoretical Physics I" (TPI) course in Germany which is *Classical mechanics*, I would highly recommend this book to be simultaneously used with Morin, as the mathematical rigor will outshine Morin at places (The purpose of TPI is to be mathematically rigorous along with giving a good understanding of CM).
  
  It's very unlikely anywhere outside Germany that your first course in CM covers Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (Can happen though), but if it does, this is the book you want to open. He covers Calculus of Variations in the most gentle way possible. It's a slow, steady and extremely effective approach. In my opinion, the whole book is amazing, but the parts on Calculus of variations, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics are especially inspired.
  
  The chapter on Special relativity is also very concise and offers a ton of intuition.
