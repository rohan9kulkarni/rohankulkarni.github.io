### <span style="color:orange"> General advice </span>

For the love of Schrodinger, do not start learning Quantum mechanics (QM) without the prerequisites. The prerequisites being at least one course in each of the following :
- Classical mechanics (At least at the level of first 9 chapters of Morin)
- Electrodynamics (At least at the level of first 7 chapters of Griffiths)
- Vibrations and Waves (A student's guide to Waves - Daniel Fleisch. The entire booklet preferably)

**Q)** Why not to skip the prerequisites?
**Ans.** There is a chance that you will partially understand concepts and maybe, even solve some problems in introductory texts.  But, you will definitely miss a very crucial chunk of conceptual knowledge that comes by making analogies with ED. Comparing the continuity equation between ED and QM (based on the Wavefunction).

**Q)** But, What if I want to be a "Quantum Physicist"?
**Ans.** There is quite a big misconception, even amongst Physics students that you can be a *Quantum physicist*. QM is a framework. You need this framework to explain natural phenomenon in nearly every field of physics. The extent to which you need the framework depends on the size of your domain. Whenever you are dealing with microscopic properties of a theory, you are always going to need the framework. Particle physics, AMO physics (atomic and molecular physics), condensed matter physics, Quantum computing & information, Biophysics are the fields where you have to use this framework at each and every step as your domain of interest is *tiny particles*. In Condensed matter and Biophysics you deal with ensembles of particles, where you use Statistical mechanics (Classical or Quantum) in abundance. 

**Q)** (Keen eye observer) You didn't mention Astrophysics? Is it because we are dealing with big/heavier objects?
**Ans.** Exactly. For most of the situations where you are dealing with macroscopic bodies, heavy in mass, you would use General relativity for precise calculations. But, many times you might want to look into the microscopic properties responsible for these macroscopic bodies. A good example that comes to mind is stability of Stars. (Naively speaking) The gravitational pull of the stars should make them collapse into themselves, but they don't for a significant phase of their lifetime. This is due to something called as the *degeneracy pressure* which can only be explained using QM.

### <span style="color:orange">Beginner Books (Worth a linear read) </span>

- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Introduction to Quantum Mechanics - David.J.Griffiths** </span> <br>The holy grail of all books for beginners in Quantum mechanics. He is reading a story to you. Chapter 1 dedicated to the math required for electrodynamics is super important. Solve most of the problems to get a feeling of the math that is going to be used.  The book is divided into two parts (in any logical course, you will do one part in a single semester course). 
(Someone who has read the Electrodynamics literature, might have realized it is the same advice. Yeah, both the books do jobs very parallel fashion)
- <span style = "color:#3db18b">**A student's guide to Schrodinger's equation - Daniel Fleisch**</span> <br>This 150 page booklet is in no manner a substitution to a proper text like Griffiths. But, it does a wonderful job in summarizing the most important results. This is an excellent resource to get an gist of what you will be learning.
- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Electricity and Magnetism - Edward Purcell & David Morin** </span> <br>A small fun fact about this book : Griffiths in the preface of his book writes, "Practically everything I know about electrodynamics - certainly about teaching electrodynamics - I owe to Edward Purcell". On top of that, David Morin is the same guy whose lecture notes on Mechanics are practially used by every physics student atleast once in their life. 
  Now, getting to the book, this book is so much more dense than Griffith's textbook. Every mathematical step has been laid out in detail, so intricate detail at times that it might scare the reader. A lot of solved examples, and exercises with solutions at the back of the book. The amount of topics he covers is staggering. Atleast in Germany, not a student favourite unfortunately. 
- <span style = "color:#3db18b">**Theoretical Physics III : Electrodynamics - Nolting**  </span> <br>The book is advertised as for beginners, which is not wrong, but he really gives minimal physical intuition. Nevertheless, I have found myself going to this book to look for mathematical precision. It does and impecceable job while doing this. As an example, Griffiths (or any other book above for this matter) doesn't really use the dirac delta function (distribution if some mathematician is reading this) $\delta(x-x_0)$ or the Heaviside theta function $\theta(r-r_0)$ while defining charge/current densities. The integral boundaries are set from the worded part of the problem. This is where the book shines, attention to mathematical detail so see how every step comes from the previous one. All exercises have solved solutions on the back, and the problems are excellent. The solutions are definitely not bad, but sometimes you will catch yourself going, "What? Why? How?". I like to think that he did it on purpose, he gave the solutions but still makes you think on the steps. 

### <span style="color:orange"> Advanced reference books </span>

- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Classical Electrodynamics - David Jackson** </span><br>[Solutions - Website 1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~pran/jackson/), [Solutions -Website 2](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jbourj/em.htm) <br>Do I really have to introduce this book? Fortunately or unfortunately, depends on whom you ask, my undergraduate education was completely from Jackson's book. Looking back, it was ridiculously intense doing modified Jackson problems for semester II assignments. After a few semesters when I had the opportunity to give tutorials for electrodynamics, I went back to the book and had hundreds or "Eureka" moments when I understood the real physical intuition behind several topics. This book is in no way for the weak hearted. I would highly reccomend it to students who have already studied Griffiths level electrodynamics and are looking for a challenge. 

- <span  style = "color:#3db18b"> **Principles of Electrodynamics - Melvin Schwartz** </span><br>A typical dover publication book. Basically a "No-nonsense introduction to the subject". I have a love-hate relationship with Dover books in math/physics. After a while, I realised the reason. If I try to learn a new topic from the Dover books using my traditional studying techniques (I will talk about this in another section altogether), I found myself stuck in loops at times. But, if I just pick them up like a novel and read through them, I thoroughly enjoy them. These books are more condensed but well explained. If you don't understand a section, accept the result and move on, you will eventually have to reread the section again anyway if you get my gist. You will understand it better on the repeated read. 

- <span  style = "color:#3db18b"> **Classical Electrodynamics - Walter Greiner** </span><br>Not really in the category of "Advanced", rather a reference book for everything. Not my personal favourite for a linear read.

- <span  style = "color:#3db18b"> **Course in Theoretical Physics II - The classical theory of fields : Landau Lifshitz** </span>
