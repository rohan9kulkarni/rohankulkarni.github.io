- **Top reccomendation** - [Open math waterloo](https://open.math.uwaterloo.ca/)
  - For Physicists : Linear algebra I and II
  - For Engineers : Applied linear algebra I and II


- [3Blue1Brown's - Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) - Godlike animations and explanation. This was the beginning of something new and outstanding. Not a substitute for your regular classes, but nobody, and by nobody, I literally mean nobody can give you the visual insights like him.

## <span style="color:orange">Books </span>

- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Linear algebra done right - Sheldon Axler** </span> <br> Classic. Can't really go wrong with it. Small enough to not intimidate you, yet covers everything necessary. A lot of examples and well-thought explanations.

- <span style = "color:#3db18b">**Elementary linear algebra - Howard Anton**</span> <br>  Fatter than Sheldon Axeler's book. The main reason being a lot more solved examples and step-wise solutions.

<!-- - <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Calculus - Spivak** </span> <br>A book that I would have enjoyed like I did SEH. Pretty standard again, one place where it seemed to cast shadow on my beloved SEH book is readability. -->
