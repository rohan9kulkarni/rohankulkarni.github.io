- [3Blue1Brown's - Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) - Godlike animations and explanation. This was the beginning of something new and outstanding. Not a substitute for your regular classes, but nobody, and by nobody, I literally mean nobody can give you the visual insights like him.

## <span style="color:orange">Books </span>

- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Calculus of one and more than one variables - Salas, Etgen, Hille (SEH)** </span> <br>Honestly, my first proper university level calculus course was a coagulation of _real analysis_ and _calculus for physicists_. Having done "calculus" in high school, I used this and only this book extensively cause, I never needed any other. It literally had every theorem, technique and derivation from the _calculus for physicists_ part of the course. Tons of examples, diagrams, boxed results and intuitions. Really, never even touched another book. 

- <span style = "color:#3db18b">**Calculus - Stewart**</span> <br> Highly reccomended by colleagues. Never read, but skimmed over it, everything I saw looked neat and tidy

- <span style = "color:#3db18b"> **Calculus - Spivak** </span> <br>A book that I would have enjoyed like I did SEH. Pretty standard again, one place where it seemed to cast shadow on my beloved SEH book is readability.
